# OHDSI API

This API is designed to retrieve data from an OMOP data source through a HTTP connection. It can also be used to execute OHDSI community tools such as [CohortDiagnostics](https://ohdsi.github.io/CohortDiagnostics/) and retrieve their results.

This project has been created for the [IDEA4RC project](https://www.idea4rc.eu/). It allows to connect the [vantage6](https://vantage6.ai) platform to an OMOP data source. It uses [python-ohdsi](https://python-ohdsi.readthedocs.org), a package also created in this project context to interface with the OMOP data source.

Please find the documentation on [ReadTheDocs](https://ohdsi-api.readthedocs.io/).
